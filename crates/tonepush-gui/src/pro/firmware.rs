//! Installing StompStation PRO firmware from TonePush (docs/design/
//! redesign-2026-10-01, screens 12 to 17), with the checks `tonepush pro
//! firmware-update` makes and in the order Sonulab's own procedure takes.
//!
//! Five steps, always in view: Back up, Update Mode, Write, Restart, Check.
//! The image is checked by `voidx_client::firmware::Image` before anything
//! else; the pedal is backed up, and the backup checked, before it is let
//! go; it is started in Update Mode by hand, and TonePush only reads who it
//! is then (never its libraries); every batch of the image must be confirmed
//! with the exact number of bytes sent; and TonePush never restarts the
//! pedal. Once it has the whole image the pedal is left on for five minutes
//! to finish writing, then switched off and on by hand, and TonePush checks
//! the version it comes back with and backs it up again.
