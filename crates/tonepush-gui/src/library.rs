//! The local library: tones kept on this machine, outliving any preset slot on
//! any pedal.
//!
//! A tone is stored under the hash of its own bytes, in `library/objects`, and
//! everything else points at it by that hash. That one decision settles a
//! handful of problems at once:
//!
//! - **A setlist is frozen by construction.** Editing a tone writes different
//!   bytes, so it writes a different hash; the setlist still names the old one
//!   and still plays exactly what it played. Nothing has to remember a rule.
//! - **Freezing costs nothing.** A setlist that plays a tone the library also
//!   holds is two names for one file, not two copies of it.
//! - **Renaming is free and safe.** The name is a label in the index, so
//!   changing it cannot orphan a setlist the way a file rename would.
//! - **Duplicates cannot happen.** Identical bytes are one object, exactly.
//! - **Deleting is honest.** Taking a tone out of the library forgets it from
//!   the index; the object survives as long as a setlist plays it, and goes to
//!   the trash when nothing does. No `.setlists` folder holding aside what the
//!   library pretends to have deleted.
//!
//! An object is named after its tone, because a folder you cannot read is a
//! folder you cannot trust: `CT-Blackend 8b2446f5.hxpreset`. The short hash on
//! the end is only there to tell two tones of the same name apart. The **full**
//! hash is still the identity, and it is never taken from the file name: the
//! map from hash to file is built by reading the objects and hashing them, so
//! it is always recoverable and cannot be wrong. Rename a file by hand and the
//! library still finds it; edit its bytes and it becomes what its bytes say it
//! is, which is the only honest answer.
//!
//! Objects keep their extension, so every one remains an ordinary native file:
//! `.hxpreset` for Line 6 or `.vxpreset` for the PRO. An HX document gets a
//! symbolic `.hlx` companion for publishing; a PRO preset is already its
//! portable, lossless artifact.
