//! The library's table, and the only one in the app.
//!
//! Tones from the library and from TonePush's catalog are drawn by this: they
//! differ in their columns and in nothing else, which is the point. They are
//! one library with two views of itself, and two tables that behaved
//! differently would say otherwise.
//!
//! Rows are virtualised, so a library of a few thousand tones lays out only the
//! twenty you can see, and the first columns are sticky, so scrolling sideways
//! never takes the name away from the row it belongs to. That is what
//! `egui_extras::TableBuilder` could not do: it builds every row every frame.
//!
//! The cells are prepared as plain values before the table draws. Reading them
//! costs a few short strings per row and it buys the whole thing being a value:
//! sorting, selection and editing all happen on data rather than inside a
//! drawing closure, where borrowing the app twice is a fight.
//!
//! It is drawn as the 2026-10-01 redesign draws a table: 36-point rows with a
//! hairline between them and no stripes, a 32-point header of captions, the
//! selection a neutral fill, and the sorted column named in the ink of the
//! rows rather than in amber, which is kept for the next action.
