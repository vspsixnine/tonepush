//! The design screenshots: the whole window drawn offscreen, on the GPU, with
//! invented content.
//!
//! Every scene is synthetic. Preset, tone, setlist, capture and artist names
//! are made up; HX model and knob names come from HX Edit's catalog where it
//! is installed. No pedal is opened: the app is built with channels that lead
//! nowhere and the StompStation PRO panel does not look for hardware in test
//! builds.
//!
//! Ignored by default. To render, point the data directories at scratch
//! copies so nothing personal can appear (HX Edit's data without its
//! `icons_models` and `icons_category` folders keeps Line 6's artwork out),
//! send any request for the site nowhere, and run it on its own:
//!
//! ```sh
//! TONEPUSH_SCREENSHOTS=out \
//! TONEPUSH_LIBRARY=scratch/library TONEPUSH_BACKUPS=scratch/backups \
//! TONEPUSH_CONFIG=scratch/config.json HX_RESOURCES_DEST=scratch/hx-resources \
//! TONEPUSH_SITE=http://127.0.0.1:9 \
//! gpu-lock cargo test -p tonepush-gui --lib screenshots -- --ignored --test-threads=1
//! ```
//!
//! `TONEPUSH_SCREENSHOT_SCENES` (comma separated names),
//! `TONEPUSH_SCREENSHOT_SIZES` (`1280x760,2560x1440`) and
//! `TONEPUSH_SCREENSHOT_THEMES` (`dark,light`) narrow the run. The renderer
//! insists on a discrete GPU and says which one it used.
