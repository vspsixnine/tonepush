//! The preset document: what is actually in the signal chain.
//!
//! A preset arrives as a blob whose contents are themselves MessagePack - the
//! magic string `l6-helix`, a table of section offsets, and the tone. The tone
//! holds one fixed slot array per DSP, most of the slots empty on a small
//! device. Public slot positions flatten those arrays in DSP order.
//!
//! Slots are keyed by integers throughout, so the constants here are doing the
//! work a schema would do elsewhere. They were read off captured presets and
//! cross-checked against the model catalog: a slot holding model 101 carries
//! exactly three values, and model 101 is Scream 808, which has exactly three
//! parameters.
