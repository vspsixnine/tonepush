## Install

The [Download page](/download/) has the right file for every OS, with instructions: a drag-to-Applications app for macOS, zips for Windows, archives and AUR packages for Linux. `tonepush` is the CLI, `tonepush-gui` is the editor.

Or build from source, which also installs desktop integration:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/crmne/tonepush
cd tonepush
./install.sh
```

That builds everything, puts `tonepush` on your PATH, and installs the editor: a double-clickable app on macOS, a desktop entry with an icon on Linux. `./install.sh --cli-only` skips the GUI, and `--uninstall` removes it all again.

Building needs [Rust](https://rustup.rs). On Linux the GUI additionally needs the X11/Wayland development packages any egui application does. On Debian or Ubuntu:

```sh
sudo apt install libxkbcommon-dev libwayland-dev libgl1-mesa-dev
```

### USB access on Linux

A normal user cannot open a USB device on Linux without being granted access.
`install.sh` installs rules for both Line 6 USB interfaces and the StompStation
PRO serial interface, and asks for sudo once; without them, a connection can
fail with a permission error that looks like an application bug. Replug the
device after installing. To do it by hand:

```sh
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="0e41", MODE="0666", TAG+="uaccess"' \
  | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/70-line6-hx.rules
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{manufacturer}=="SONULAB", ATTRS{product}=="StompStation PRO", MODE="0660", TAG+="uaccess"' \
  | sudo tee -a /etc/udev/rules.d/70-line6-hx.rules
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger
```

### Model names and pictures

Names, parameter ranges, value formatting, and artwork come from HX Edit's own data files, which are Line 6's and are **not** redistributed here. If HX Edit is installed on the machine, the editor copies the data by itself. Otherwise the page it shows with no pedal connected offers it as a step: **Download HX Edit** opens [line6.com/software](https://line6.com/software/), and **Find the installer** looks for the installer in your Downloads folder, or lets you choose it, either the Mac .dmg or the Windows .exe, on any OS. Dropping the installer on the window works too, except on Wayland, which does not pass dropped files on yet. The StompStation PRO needs none of this.

Reading an installer needs 7-Zip on Linux and Windows; on most distros that is the `p7zip` package, and the AUR package already suggests it. On Windows, install [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) the ordinary way and the editor finds it where the installer left it. There is nothing to add to PATH. macOS needs nothing extra.

## Connect

**Quit the vendor editor first:** HX Edit for a Line 6 device, or VoidX Control
for a StompStation PRO. Only one editor can own a device connection at a time.

Plug in the pedal and start the editor:

```sh
tonepush-gui
```

It connects on launch. Until a pedal answers, the window says to plug one in,
shows both families it looks for, and checks what it can on this computer: the
USB access rule, and HX Edit's data. While that page is open it checks USB
every two seconds, listing devices without opening any, so a pedal plugged in
later, or one another editor lets go of, connects by itself. A pedal you let go
of in TonePush is left alone until you unplug it or press **Look again**, which
looks at once. Your library is one click away.

Once a pedal is connected, the sidebar on the left is the pedal: its card at
the top, with its name and firmware, then its presets in its own banks. Across
the top runs the loaded preset, with what state it is in, its snapshots, the
tempo, undo, redo and Save. Under it are the editor and, along the bottom, your
library:

- **The editor** is the loaded preset: the signal chain across the top, the
  selected block's knobs under it, and, when the library leaves room for them,
  the pedal's footswitches and expression pedals.
- **The library** has three tabs: **Tones**, **Setlists** and **Cloud**
  (TonePush's tones, everyone's or the ones you published). Drag its top edge
  to give it more or less of the window, or double-click the edge to fold it to
  its tabs. Ctrl+L (Cmd+L on macOS) folds it and opens it again, Ctrl+1, Ctrl+2
  and Ctrl+3 open its tabs, and Ctrl+F searches the open one. A click on a
  tone plays it on the pedal in the loaded preset's place, until you keep it
  or put it back (see [The Workflow](/the-workflow/)). With nothing chosen,
  its details are the loaded preset's tone. TonePush remembers its
  height, and whether it is folded, for each size of window. When it leaves
  the editor little room, the block's knobs go onto one row that scrolls
  sideways, and then the editor keeps the block's name alone.
- **The pedal's own pages**: click the pedal's card for its backups, impulse
  responses, favourite blocks, global EQ, settings and an activity log, or
  choose one from the menu its arrows open. **Back to the preset** (Esc)
  returns to the editor. The library starts folded there, ready to open.

Ctrl+B (Cmd+B on macOS) hides the sidebar when the page needs the width.

That layout is the same for both families. The available blocks and operations
follow the pedal's capabilities. The PRO does not need HX Edit resources; it supplies its names,
ranges, choices, NAM models, and IR names through its own schema. See the
[StompStation PRO guide](/stompstation-pro/) for its verified rollback guard.

A few things worth knowing on day one:

- **Edits are live but not saved.** The device edits a scratch copy: a changed parameter is audible immediately but vanishes on reload unless you press Save. When there is something to save, the line under the preset's name says **Changes not saved**, the preset's row has an orange dot, and Save turns amber.
- **Add a block** by clicking any gap in the wire. The model browser opens in place of the knobs, ready for you to type; one click puts the model in the gap.
- **Try other models** with **Change model**, or by clicking the block's name. Each model you click plays on the pedal at once, its knobs at their defaults. **Keep** (Enter) keeps the one playing, as one step undo can take back; **Put back** (Esc) returns the block exactly as it was. The browser remembers what you chose under **Recent**.
- **Give a knob a control** by right-clicking it, or clicking its name: a footswitch, an expression pedal, MIDI or the snapshots. Click a reading to type a value; double-click a knob for its default.
- **Footswitches and Snapshots** sit beside **Block** at the right of the block's head, and a click on a switch along the bottom opens it. The first shows every switch and pedal with what it carries, and lets you name a switch, choose its light, make it hold or toggle, and set where each control it carries starts and ends. The second shows which blocks each snapshot turns on and the tempo each keeps. On a large window all of it is on screen at once.
- **Make a parallel branch** by dragging a block onto the dashed branch below the line, or by clicking the + on it.
- **Move the fork and merge** by dragging their dots along the line.
- **Undo, redo, save** are Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Shift+Z, and Ctrl+S (Cmd on macOS).

## Handle with care

These devices can lock up hard enough to need their 9V adapter pulled; a USB replug is not enough, because the unit is externally powered and keeps its session across re-enumeration. Every lock-up during development traced back to the client, not the hardware, and each cause is now understood, avoided, and pinned by a regression test. The full post-mortem is in [PROTOCOL.md](https://github.com/crmne/tonepush/blob/main/PROTOCOL.md).
